abstract = {The explosion of data volume has gradually transformed big data processing from the static batch mode to the online streaming model. Streaming data can be divided into instance streams (feature space remains fixed while instances increase over time), feature streams (instance space is fixed while features arrive over time), or both. Generally, online streaming data learning has two main challenges: infinite length and concept changing. Recently, feature stream learning has received much attention. However, existing feature stream learning methods focus on feature selection or classification but ignore the concept changing over time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies concept evolution detection over feature streams. Specifically, we first give the formal definition of concept evolution over feature streams, which include three different types: concept emerging, concept drift, and concept forgetting. Then, we design a novel framework to detect the concept evolution over feature streams that consists of a sliding window, an improved density peak-based clustering algorithm, and a weighted bipartite graph-based concept detecting method. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several synthetic and high-dimensional datasets to indicate our new methodâ€™s ability to cluster and detect concept evolution over feature streams.},
