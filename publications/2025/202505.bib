abstract = {Data is exploding in many fields and may exist in the streaming mode. When the generation speed of massive streaming data far exceeds the processing speed of a single node, and the generated data needs to be processed in real-time, traditional centralized learning models are challenging in meeting the efficiency requirements. Therefore, online distributed learning models emerge. As time progresses, features may continuously emerge from various sources in a distributed and heterogeneous fashion. Therefore, we study the problem of online distributed heterogeneous streaming feature selection and propose a novel framework to address it, named DHSFS. The framework comprises two main components: sub-node streaming feature selection and global information synchronization. The sub-node component uses a dynamic strategy to select strong features, discard irrelevant ones, and cache weakly relevant features. In the global information synchronization stage, each sub-node synchronizes statistics information with the master node to adjust the global thresholds dynamically. Finally, the features selected by each sub-node are summarized and output. Experiments on 16 datasets show that the DHSFS framework has both high prediction accuracy and high efficiency of online stream feature selection.},
